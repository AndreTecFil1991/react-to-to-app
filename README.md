# React To Do App

A TodoApp made with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Getting Started

It's required the download of source code from [my repository](https://github.com/AndreTecFil1991/react-to-do-app).

### Prerequisites

It's required to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed in the system.

Example for debian based systems
```
sudo apt-get install node
```

### Installing

The following steps will be decribed assuming that node is already installed in the system.

Navigate for the downloaded folder (please teake note that [dir] represents your local folder directory and all the following commands are to be run on that directory):

```
cd [dir]
```

And install node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that we can run an eslint to check the code:

```
npm run-script lint
```

## Running the tests

To run the existing unit tests it's only required to run the following command:

```
npm run-script test
```

To exit the tests interface is enough to press 'Ctrl+C' and continue with the desired flow.

## Build

To build the project run the following command:

```
npm run-script build
```

## Deployment

To deploy the project build it's required to run the following command and wait for it on default browser:

```
npm start
```

Here is a [demo](https://andretecfil1991.github.io/react-to-to-app/) for the project to explore without all the installing and build process.
